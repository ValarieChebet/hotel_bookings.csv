Title: Forecasting Hotel Booking Cancellations Using Machine Learning

Course Relevance: This topic applies concepts from Data Science and Machine Learning by using real-world data to solve a predictive analytics problem.

2. Problem Definition 
Objective:
To identify the key factors that influence hotel booking cancellations and to build a predictive model that can classify whether a booking will be canceled or not.

3. Background Study 
Summary:
Hotel booking cancellation prediction is important for operational planning in the hospitality industry. Past studies have used logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods to analyze features like lead time, number of special requests, booking changes, and customer type.

Dataset:
The dataset (hotel_bookings.csv) contains booking information including customer demographics, booking habits, and hotel preferences.

4. Methodology or Approach 
Steps Taken:

Data Cleaning: Removed null or irrelevant records, encoded categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize trends in cancellations.

Feature Engineering: Created new variables such as total stay duration, seasonality, etc.

Modeling: Applied Random Forest Classifier.

Evaluation: Used accuracy score, confusion matrix, ROC curve.

Tools/Technologies:

Python (pandas, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib)

Jupyter Notebook

5. Implementation or Analysis 
Key Work:

Code to load and explore the dataset

Visualizations of cancellation rates across different features (e.g., lead time, deposit type)

Random Forest model training and prediction

Importance of variables calculated using permutation importance

Example Output:

Accuracy Score: (Placeholder until checked)

ROC AUC: (Placeholder until checked)

Key Features: Lead time, deposit type, previous cancellations

6. Results and Conclusion 
Findings:

Long lead times and non-refundable deposits are strong predictors of cancellation.

The Random Forest model performed with an accuracy of around X% and AUC of Y.
